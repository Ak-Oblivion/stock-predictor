Project Summary:
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict stock prices using historical data. I used an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network, which is designed to find patterns in time series data. The model learned from past stock prices and other features to forecast the next day’s closing price.

Key Learnings:
  I learned how to prepare and scale data for machine learning models, including creating sequences for time series forecasting.
  I implemented an LSTM network in PyTorch, which captures patterns over time, and trained it to predict future stock prices.
  I evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error and Median Absolute Percentage Error to measure accuracy.
  I visualized both predicted and actual stock prices to understand how well the model captured trends and changes.
  
Reflection:
This project gave me experience in data preprocessing, time series modeling, and neural networks. It reinforced how quantitative methods and programming can combine to make informed predictions in uncertain environments. It also showed me the importance of testing, evaluation, and visualization when interpreting model outputs.
